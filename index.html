                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elitThe great cuckoo-dove was originally described in 1824 as Columba reinwardtsi by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck on the basis of a specimen from Ambon Island, Indonesia, although Temminck erroneously stated that specimen came from Sulawesi.[5] The spelling reinwardtsi was a misprint for reinwardtii, and Temminck himself used the latter spelling in his table of contents;[6] however, other authors have emended the name to reinwardti, and both of these spellings are currently used.[5]

                    In 1854, the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte created the genus Reinwardtoena for the species, referring to it as Reinwardtoena typica.[7] Both the generic and specific names are in honour of the Dutch naturalist Caspar Reinwardt.[8] Great cuckoo-dove is the official common name designated by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOU).[9] Other English common names for the species include long-tailed cuckoo-dove, Reinwardt's cuckoo-dove, giant cuckoo-dove, Reinwardt's long-tailed pigeon, chestnut-and-grey pigeon, and maroon-and-grey pigeon.[10] In the Sansundi language of Biak Island, it is known as Man Wupu.[11]
